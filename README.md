airodump-ng and GPSd have been found to play nicely with each other, but how can usage be made easier? <br>
Perhaps if we wrapped some Python around everything to launch/terminate airodump instances, kind of <br>
like Sparrow-Wifi or Falcon, we can have a smarter system by geofencing with geopy
 <br>
Requirements: <br>
-Python 3 <br>
-GPSd <br>
-aircrack-ng suite <br>
-geopy <br>
-gpsd-py3 <br>
